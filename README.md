# pneumonia-detection
Detect pneumonia from chest X-rays using CNN (Tensorflow) and SVM (sklearn). There are two possible outputs: healthy and pneumonia. : Dataset is imbalanced (1342 healthy X-rays and 3876 pneumonia ones for training), so class_weight is set to balanced in the SVM classifier, and data augmentation is used for the Convolutional Neural Network to account for that. SVM accuracy lies around ~79% , while the CNN can hit ~88%. Try experimenting with the hyperparameters to increase accuracy. 
# How to use/required libraries
Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/download, unzip and put the chest_xray folder in the project's root directory. Libraries used include numpy, matplotlib, opencv-python, seaborn, tensorflow, seaborn, sklearn. I personally used Google Colab which has them all preinstalled by default.
